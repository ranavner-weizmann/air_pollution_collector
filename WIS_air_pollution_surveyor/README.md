# WIS_air_pollution_surveyor
This is a repository for working on the Drone Team's software.
There are 2 main folders here: 
Development: this is where we put all of the experimental stuff, drafts, tests... 
Operational: this is the code the operational system is using. Things that are put here have to be tested to make sure the whole system still works. 

## Remember to activate venv using: source /home/pi/evia/venv/bin/activate
## Remember to run from /home/pi/evia/WIS_air_pollution_surveyor/Development/drone_dori/sensors
## Remember to change is_on.txt in sensors file to Off or something like that for the process to check if runall is running or not if dont want runall to execute(runall writes On to the file) (Not yet effective)
